                    <p class="sectionheader">Overview</p>
                        <p class="info-text">The Strike freedom is a mobile suit first appearing the second O.M.N.I-PLANT war fought between an alliance of nations on Earth and the space colonies knowns as the PLANTs situated at Lagrange 5.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">It was originally developed by ZAFT (the PLANT military) as a prototype unit intended for mass production. This design data was stolen by the Clyne faction and was then redeveloped based on the operational data of it's predecessor, the ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. This redevelopment was completed with the intention of the unit being piloted by Kira Yamato, a veteran of the first O.M.N.I-PLANT war.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">The primary armaments of the Strike Freedom feature an array of powerful ranged weaponry including both projectile and energy beam based cannons. The unit emphasizes maneuverability over armour and was designed for high speed combat. The armour plates were split into smaller pieces to improve the movement range ot the unit's joints, this did however expose more of the skeleton and frame of the unit. Because of this, much of the internal structure was built using phase-shift (PS) armour materials to compensate for the extra exposure.</p>

                    <div class="armaments">
                        <p class="sectionheader">Armaments</p>
                            <ul class="weapons">
                                <li class="list-header">MMI-GAU27D 31mm CIWS</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The pair of CIWS' (Close in weapons system) fitted to the Strike Freedom are mounted in the head of the unit, one on either side. These are primarily used for intercepting incoming missiles and units and are highly reliable weapons.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">MGX-2235 "Calidus" Multi-Phase Beam Cannon</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The Calidus is a chest mounted high caliber beam weapon. It draws power from the unit's Hyper Deuterion Engine which allows for high-powered blasts and rapid fire capabilities. The muzzle is protected by PS armour and it is the most powerful beam weapon fitted to the unit.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">MX2200 Beam Shield</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The Strike Freedom is fitted with a beam shield generator in each forearm. When activated they are able to block most beam and physical attacks. They do however consume a high amount of energy, this is offset by the large output of the Hyper Deuterion Engine.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">MA-M02G "Super Lacerta" Beam Saber</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The two Super Lacerta beam sabers are the unit's primary close combat weapons. They are mounted on the railguns attached to the waist section of the unit. They can be combined to form a double-edged  beam saber referred to as the 'Ambidextrous Halberd'.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">MMI-M15E "Xiphias 3" Railgun</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">Two railguns are mounted either side of the unit's waist, these are an upgraded version of the ZGMF-X10A Freedom's original Xiphias Railgun. They are designed to be more powerful and have a simplified structure compared to their predecessor. They can also be used to hit enemy units in the water as they fire a high-speed physical projectile giving the Strike Freedom underwater combat capabilities. They cannot, however, be used when folded to the back of the waist to accomodate the storage of beam rifles.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">MA-M21KF High Energy Beam Rifle</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The unit features two High Energy Beam Rifles. These can be combined to form one long-range rifle allowing for effective combat capability at various ranges. Having two rifles also improves combat capability when faced with multiple enemy units.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">EQFU-3X Super DRAGOON Mobile Weapon Wing & MA-80V Beam Assault Cannon</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The Super DRAGOON Mobile Weapon wing is a rear-mounted compound equipment featuring an armament platform and a high-thrust propulsion system. The DRAGOONs are a wireless guided weapon pod fitted with a beam assault cannon. One DRAGOON is mounted to each of the platforms eight wings. These weapon pods are able to fire beams at long range or can emit a beam blade for combat at close quarters. They can be formed into groups to unleash crippling barrages of beam fire or tasked to individual targets.</p>    
                            </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="equipmentfeatures">
                        <p class="sectionheader">Special Equipment & features</p>
                            <ul class="equipment">
                                <li class="list-header">High-Mobility Aerial Tactics (HiMAT) Mode</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The HiMAT system unfolds the eight wings of the mobile weapon platform mounted to the rear of the unit. This provides increased maneuverability during aerial combat. In space this system also enhances the Strike Freedom's AMBAC (Active Mass Balance Auto-Contro) capability.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Multi Lock-On System</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">This is a system used to target multiple enemy units and attack simultaneously. Effective use of the system requires a high level of spacial awareness from the pilot. The system can also be used when docked with the METEOR unit.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Full Burst Mode</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">When Full Burst Mode is engaged, the Strike Freedom uses all of it's rifles, DRAGOONS, railguns and it's multi-phase beam cannonat once. It is often used alongside the Multi Lock-On System. The DRAGOONS grant exceptional range and 360 degree firing capability. Unfortunately due to Earth's gravity, the DRAGOONS are not able to be used during in-atmosphere engagements.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">"Voiture Lumiere" Propulsion System</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The propulsion system is mounted on the unit's mobile weapon wing. It uses an internal laser and converts this energy into strong light pressure and uses this as thrust. It allows for incredible acceleration and enhances the unit's evasive abilities.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Hyper Deuterion Engine</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The engine installed in the Strike Freedom is a hybrid system using a nuclear reactor alongside a deuterion beam energy tranfer system. This engine provides an incredibly high output and supplies enough power for the unit to use the METEOR system.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Neutron Jammer Canceller</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">This system disables the effects of N-Jammers (a series of nodes fired into the Earth's crust to prevent the development and use of nuclear technology). It allows the Strike Freedom the ability to operate on earth without causing it's engine to fail.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Operating System</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The Strike Freedom boasts the Generation Unsubdued Nuclear Drive Assault Module (G.U.N.D.A.M) complex operating system. The system has unrivalled response times to pilot inputs and allows complete freedom of movement for the unit.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">Variable Phase Shift Armour</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The unit is equipped with Variable Phase Shift Armour, an updated version of the original Phase-Shift system used by the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam and it's counterpart suits developed alongside it. It allows for the sutomatic changing of the armour's strength, colour and power consumption during combat. These must be programmed as presets by the pilot before deployment.</p>
                                <li class="list-header">METEOR Unit</li>
                                    <p class="info-text">The METEOR unit is a large mobile weapons platform that can be docked to the Strike Freedom. It is equipped with powerful thruster, battleship caliber beam cannons, large beam swords and an numerous array of heavy missile launchers.</p>
